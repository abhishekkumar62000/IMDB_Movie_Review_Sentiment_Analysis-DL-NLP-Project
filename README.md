Welcome to my latest project: **IMDB_Movie_Review_Sentiment_Analysis**! 🌟 This is a deep learning and natural language processing (NLP) project aimed at predicting the sentiment of movie reviews as either **Positive** or **Negative**. 🚀

---

## 📚 Project Overview
In this project, I have implemented a complete machine learning pipeline to analyze IMDB movie reviews and determine their sentiment. The project focuses on applying advanced **Feature Engineering**, **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, and **Model Building** using cutting-edge tools like **sklearn** and **PyTorch**. 🔍🧠

## ⚙️ Key Highlights:

- **Data Collection & Preprocessing** 📊
  - The dataset contains labeled movie reviews, which are preprocessed to clean and prepare text for analysis. 🧹
  - Data preprocessing steps include:
    - Removing stopwords 🛑
    - Tokenization 🔑
    - Lemmatization 📚
    - Handling missing values 🧠
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 🔍
  - Visualizing review lengths, sentiment distribution, and identifying important features for building a better model. 📈
  - Understanding word frequency distributions and sentiment correlations with **matplotlib** and **seaborn**. 📊
  
- **Feature Engineering** 🛠️
  - Implemented techniques like **TF-IDF** and **Word2Vec** to transform the text data into numerical features. 💻
  - Handled class imbalance using **SMOTE** and **undersampling**. ⚖️

- **Model Building** 🤖
  - Built a sentiment classifier using **sklearn** with models like **Logistic Regression**, **SVM**, and **Random Forest**. 🌲
  - Utilized **PyTorch** for deep learning-based approaches, including an LSTM model for sequence processing. 🧠🔥
  
- **Model Evaluation** 📝
  - Performance evaluation using metrics such as **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1-Score**, and **ROC Curve**. 📊
